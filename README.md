# Pitch Card Generator
This is an application that generates random baseball/softball pitch calling cards. The user enters up to ten pitches (name, abbreviation, and percentage), and those pitches are randomly sorted into a printable grid that fits on the player's wrist. A matching coach sheet is generated as well. Multiple sheets can be created from the same data.
